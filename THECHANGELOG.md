1.48.1;

### Additions:
Changed "Load Autosave" to "Load Backup From File" which allows you to load not only autosaves, but chart files individually. ([basically a copy of loadjson lmao](https://github.com/JordanSantiagoYT/FNF-JS-Engine/pull/1097))
Introduced TJSON support, currently for week JSONs, with potential for broader use. This is to assist those unfamiliar with JSON format.

### Removals:
Neo has been removed due to drama.

### Fixes:

Addressed an issue where notes were not despawning as expected, which should also improve input handling. (Hopefully)
* Health Icon Improvements:
* Fixed issues with broken health icon sizes. (I hope)
* Added support for icon metadata.
* Implemented animated health icons for enhanced visual feedback.
